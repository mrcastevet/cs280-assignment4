# cs280-assignment4

## Language Interpreter

This assignment has a connection to the previous assignment of creating a Recursive Decent Parser. The Interpreter is a slight modification of the previous assignment in that it will now not only check for syntax errors but also run the assigned statements.

## Implementation

The Language Interpreter uses value checking along with the previous format of the Recursive Decent Parser to check for not only syntax errors but also runtime errors, and evalutes and executes code with the help of the Value class.
